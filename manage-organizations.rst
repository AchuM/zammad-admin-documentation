Organizations
*************

Organizations allow you to group customers. This has two important advantages, among other things.

1. As an agent you have not only the overview of a customer's tickets, but also an overview of the entire organization. For example, by searching for the organization, all the tickets are displayed and they can be opened easily by click.
2. As a customer, you can view and edit your colleagues' tickets (if the organization is a "share", you can set this as the parameter for each organization).

Here you can manually add, edit or delete existing organizations. Within the organization can be set the following things:

- if it's a shared organization (All customers who are assigned to this organization can view and edit the group tickets)
- if the assignment is domain based (assign users based on domain)
- note
- if it's active or inactive
