Macros
******

You can use macros in Zammad to automate recurring sequences, saving time (and nerves). This allows a combined sequence of actions on the ticket to be executed with just one click.

In this mask you can add, edit and delete macros. One macro can contain any number of changes to the ticket. 

Is a macro created, it can be applied via two paths:

1. In the ticket on the right lower corner. There is an arrow next to the "update" button. All active macros are displayed here.
2. If you want to apply a macro for more then one ticket, you have to select all the corresponding tickets, click on them and move the mouse pointer. Now all macros are displayed and you can move all the tickets into it.

 It is advisable to make a note on the ticket when carrying out the action. This ensures that this step is visible to all users in the ticket.
