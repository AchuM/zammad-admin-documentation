Report-Profiles
***************

Report profiles are used to restrict / filter report-results. The group of tickets that you want to evaluate are usually set here. For example, all tickets from the support area or all tickets from a particular customer.
The filters can be combined with each other as desired. The filters build on each other, which means that they are further restricted per additional attribute.
