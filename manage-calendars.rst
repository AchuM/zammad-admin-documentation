Calendars
*********

A calendar is required to calculate escalations or reports based on business hours.

Define a "standard" calendar which system-wide is valid. Only in the specified business hours, escalation notifications are sent to agents.

If you have customers for which you have to comply with different customer business hours, you can create several calendars. The allocation to the customer tickets can be adjusted via the SLAs.
