Overviews
*********

You can provide overviews to your agents and customers. They can be used as a kind of worklist of tasks that the agent is supposed to work off.
You can also create individual reports for individual agents or agent groups.
Here you can add new overviews, edit or delete them. The following attributes can be set when creating an overview:

- Is it only available for a specific role the overview?
- Is it only available for certain users?
- Is it only available for users with shared organizations? (that's a setting in the organizations-management)
- What conditions should the listed tickets contain (=filter)? You can add more than one condition.
- Which attributes shall be shown in the overview (column headers)?
- In which order the tickets are to be displayed? (Sorted by the attributes)
- The direction of the order
- Do you want the tickets to be displayed again grouped by a specific attribute within the list?
- Set them active or inctive
