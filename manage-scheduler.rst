Scheduler
*********

The sheduler performs time-based automated actions. Such an action may be a change of any information on the tickets.

That's how it works:
1. You set the time when the job should run
2. Determine the ticket attributes (Conditions) to limit the tickets on which an action is to be performed
3. Determine the change to be made on the ticket. It is advisable to make a note on the ticket when carrying out the action. This ensures that this step is visible to all users in the ticket.

It is also possible to set the scheduler to inactive here.
