Tags
****

With tags, tickets can be categorized and marked.  You can list all the marked tickets by tag, either either by means of a corresponding overview, by a search-query or by clicking on the tag in this form.
Here's an overview of existing tags used in the system (and a counter how often they are used).
It can be set whether the agents are allowed to add tags themselves or not (in the lef upper corner). You can add more Tags or delete them. By clicking on the counter, the search details can be used to output a list of all tickets that were tagged.
