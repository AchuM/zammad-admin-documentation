Users
*****

This is the user-management-area. There is an overview about all registered users in the system. That includes agents, admins and customer. When you select a role, all users that are assigned to this role are displayed.
On the right a new user can be created and edited by clicking on an existing user. It's also possible to show the view from user's perspective (scroll over the action-column).
The mask to add and edit users have the same structure:

- adding all relevant information about a user. If there are more information needed, it is possible to add a attribute in the object-management (system --> objects-->users)
- users can be assigned to an organization 
- users can be set as a VIP (These users can be selected specifically for the SLA or other automatisms, in which these users must be distinguished from other users)
- set or change password
- assign user rights
- set user active/inactive
