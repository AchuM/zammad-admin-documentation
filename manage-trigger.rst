Trigger
*******

Triggers perform action-based changes to the ticket. Auto-replys on tickets are also implemented via this function.

That's how it works:

1. Determine the ticket attributes (conditions) to limit the tickets on which an action is to be performed (these can also be arbitrarily combined and thus specified)
2. Determine the change to be made on the ticket. It is advisable to make a note on the ticket when carrying out the action. This ensures that this step is visible to all users in the ticket later. 

a) You can eather change ticket-information automatically or 
b) send an e-mail to the customer or agent of the relevant ticket or to all agents in the system.
