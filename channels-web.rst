You can define wheather a customer can create tickets via the web interface or not.
IF they can you can furthermore define groups for which a customer can create tickets via web interface. "-" means all groups are available.

That means for example: if you are working with a dispatcher, you could implement a group "Income" and only select this group here. Thus, all incoming tickets are routed to this group and can be dispached to other groups from here.
