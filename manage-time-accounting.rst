Time Accounting
***************

If you want to know how much time you need for your each project, you can enable time accounting.
It can be set for which tickets the time accounting is activated - that means for which tickets you can enter, how much time was needed. It's possible to set multible conditions.
There is an monthly overview for all counted time. The tickets can be arranged according to customers and organization. All views can be downloaded as a CSV file (click on the down arrow)
